Challenges & Successes Encountered

We went through lots of challenges due to the fact that we had chosen another project that in the end was more than we could achieve as a team in the time available. We had set up to build an app that gamifies the interview process. Learning and reviewing software development knowledge while playing a fun and interactive card game where the user chose left or right depending on their answer, while defeating "evil Interviewer bosses" and getting "Hired" if they defeated all the bosses by answering most questions correctly . We were unable to learn the new technologies needed to build the game on time as well as confusion on what member of the team had responsability over. Also there was a misplacements of tasks that was not equally balanced.
